## About

This repository contains a curated set of small-to-medium sized code examples and refactoring exercises designed to help developers sharpen design, readability, and testability skills. Each exercise is intentionally concise so you can iterate quickly and see measurable improvement. üöÄ

Purpose:
- Learn refactoring patterns and principles (SRP, OCP, DRY, KISS, YAGNI).
- Practice writing tests and creating safer, cleaner code.
- Share small PRs with clear commits and rationale.

---

## What's included üîç

- /exercises ‚Äî Individual refactoring exercises (numbered, with before/after suggestions).
- /solutions ‚Äî Reference implementations (kept minimal, with tests).
- /docs ‚Äî Supplementary notes, patterns, and checklists.
- Tests for each exercise (where applicable) so you can verify behavior before/after refactor.

Each exercise contains:
- problem.md ‚Äî description & failing tests / examples
- before/ ‚Äî original code
- after/ (optional) ‚Äî suggested refactor / solution
- tests/ ‚Äî unit tests demonstrating expected behavior

---

## Getting started ‚ö°

### Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16 (if exercises are JS/TS) or language-specific runtime as applicable.
- Git for cloning.
- Recommended: an editor with linting (VS Code + ESLint/Prettier).

### Install
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Robert-ctrlc/RefactoringExercise2025.git
cd RefactoringExercise2025
```

Install dependencies (if applicable):
```bash
# JavaScript / TypeScript example
npm install
```

### Run tests / examples
Run all tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run a single exercise (example):
```bash
# run the test for exercise-01
npm test -- exercises/exercise-01
```

(Adjust commands to the repo's language and tooling as needed.)

## Project structure üß≠

- exercises/
  - exercise-01/
    - before/
    - after/
    - tests/
    - problem.md
- solutions/

Naming convention: exercise-## ‚Äî lowest friction to open small PRs.

## How to work through the exercises ‚úÖ

1. Pick an exercise from /exercises.
2. Run its tests to see failing behavior that describes the refactor target.
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b fix/exercise-01-yourname`.
4. Refactor in small steps, keep tests green.
5. Open a PR with:
   - short title: "Refactor: exercise-01 ‚Äî Extract X"
   - description: what you changed and why + before/after snippets
6. Request reviews and iterate.

Tip: Aim for descriptive commits that tell the refactoring story.

## Contributing ü§ù

Contributions are welcome! Please:
- Open issues for ideas or broken examples.
- Create small, focused PRs.
- Run tests and linters before submitting.
- Follow the style guide below.

If you'd like to add new exercises, include:
- a clear problem.md
- failing tests that justify the refactor
- a short "learning goals" list

---

## Style & conventions üßæ

- Tests should be deterministic and small.
- Keep functions focused ‚Äî one responsibility each.
- Prefer immutability where reasonable.
- Document intent with short comments; let tests express behavior.
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables and functions.

Suggested tools:
- ESLint + Prettier
- Jest / Mocha / pytest (depending on language)
